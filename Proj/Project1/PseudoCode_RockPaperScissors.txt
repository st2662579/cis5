                // Output the winner
                // Use roundWinner variable to determine the winner. If 0, it's a tie. If 1, player 1 wins. If 2, player 2 wins.
                // Increase the score accordingly or decrease match number if it's a tie.

        
        // Conclude
        // Output who the winner is
        
        // Ask the user if they want to play again.
        // Read input

        // If input is Y/y, set playAgain to true and repeat the game.
